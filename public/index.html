        <h1>How to Treat Horses</h1>

        <p>Horses need gentle, consistent care. Always approach calmly, speak softly, and avoid sudden movements.
            Provide fresh water, proper feed, and regular grooming. Clean hooves daily and ensure safe, spacious living
            conditions. Respect their space, never hit or yell, and build trust through patience and positive
            reinforcement. Regular veterinary check-ups keep them healthy and happy.</p>

        <p>Did you know? Horses are obligate nasal breathers. This means that they are unable to breathe through their
            mouth as humans can. Horses can only breathe through their nose.</p>
